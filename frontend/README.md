# UNICON Frontend

This folder contains separated HTML pages for each dashboard section to make editing easier without digging through a single large file.

Pages:
- `for-you.html` — Announcements and the main feed
- `community.html` — Community/forums
- `messages.html` — Direct messages / moments
- `marketplace.html` — School store and student listings
- `calendar.html` — Academic calendar and events
- `profile.html` — Student profile

Notes:
- Each page includes a simple bottom navigation that links across these files.
- Branding assets reference `../UNICON.png`. Update paths if you reorganize assets.
- If you want to share components/scripts across pages, consider adding a `frontend/js/` folder and referencing shared scripts.
